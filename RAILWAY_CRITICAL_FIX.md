# Railway 404 Critical Fix - DEPLOYED

## Problem
Railway was showing HTTP 404 for all routes including API endpoints, indicating the application wasn't starting properly.

## Root Cause
Railway's build process wasn't copying the built static files to where the Express server expects them (server/public/).

## Solution Applied
Modified `railway.json` to include direct static file copy in build command:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "commands": ["npm install", "npm run build", "mkdir -p server/public && cp -r dist/* server/public/"]
  },
  "start": {
    "command": "npm start"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Status
- ✅ GitHub commit pushed successfully
- ✅ Railway auto-deployment triggered
- → Railway processing new build with static file fix

## Expected Result
insidemeter.com should serve properly with:
- Static files loading from server/public/
- All API endpoints responding correctly
- Authentication system fully functional

## Timeline
Deployed: July 22, 2025 at 11:40 AM
Expected completion: 5-10 minutes for Railway build

This is the simplest possible fix - Railway now copies built files directly where the server expects them.
